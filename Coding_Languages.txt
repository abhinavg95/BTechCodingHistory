C is the coding language primarily taught to first years.

C++ is the successor to C.

Since some first years might find the syntax of the C language to be a little difficult, python may also be chosen as the primary language.

C is a compiled language while Python is interpreted. It's really easy to understand.

Python has a syntax closest to the real world.

Even though C, C++, python might find craze among youngsters, JAVA is the most industry driven language.

Both C++ and JAVA are based on C. Someone who has a good command on C, can easily grasp C++ and JAVA concepts.

OOPS is a concept that comes into play when we move from C to C++ and JAVA.

OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming.

Let's look at the simplicity of Python
Let's see how the print function is written -
1. C - printf("Hello World\n");
2. C++ - cout << "Hello World" << endl;
3. Python - print("Hello World") 
4. JAVA - System.out.println("Hello World");

Without the C language , most of the modern languages wouldn't have existed.
It's high time we appreciate it's importance.

Students in the beginning atleast are afraid of the C language, because the syntax seems scary to them compared to the other languages. 

When C++ comes into play, scary syntax like printf and scanf are replaced by cin or cout. Coding becomes easier.

Hello World in C -> printf("Hello World");
